Hi,
Here is a project which I have done regarding Banking transactions fraudulent data analysis using SQL and Power BI dashboard and extracted many insights that will definitely helpful for Banking 
stakeholders to understand the customer behavior and theri transactions fraudulent analysis. Validated all the values by using SQL. 
The data collected from one of the open source data platform i.e #kaggle.

The following insights that I have extracted from the data.
1. Overall Performance:
i. Total transaction volume over the specified period?
ii. How has the total transaction volume changed over time?
iii. How has the fraud and succefull transactions over the time?

2. Fraud Analysis:
i. What is the percentage of fraudulent transactions in the dataset?
ii. identified patterns or trends in the occurrence of fraudulent transactions?

3. Geographic Analysis:
i. Specific cities with a higher incidence of fraud?
ii. How does the distribution of transactions vary across different cities?

4. Transaction Analysis:
i. What are the most common transaction types in the dataset?
ii. Specific transaction types more prone to fraud?
iii. What patterns or characteristics are common among successful transactions?
iv. what is the total amout of fraudulent transaction?
v. what is the successful transactional amount?
vi.percentage of successful transaction amount?

5. Card Type Analysis:
i. How does the distribution of transactions vary based on card types?
ii. What are certain card types more frequently associated with fraud?

6. Expense Type Analysis:
i. What are the predominant expense types in the dataset?
ii. what are most usage type of card for expense types.

7.Customer Behavior:
i. How do individual customers contribute to the overall transaction volume?
ii. customers transaction pattern over the period?

8.Gender Analysis:
i. Any noticeable difference in transaction behavior between genders?
ii. Are there gender-specific trends related to fraud?

These are the few insights i have extracted by using Power BI Dashboard as attached here. I have treied to cover all questions aim to cover a range of aspects, including overall performance, 
fraud analysis, geographic patterns, transaction types, card types, expense types, customer behavior, gender analysis and success transaction patterns. Banking Stakeholders can use the insights 
gained from these questions to make informed decisions, enhance fraud prevention strategies and improve overall business processes.
